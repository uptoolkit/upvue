# Up Ui

Ui components library for changemakers based on Ant Design and compatible with Tailwind UI.

## Why ?

Ant Design has good Ui Components but it lacks of compatibility with Tailwind UI and have some conflicts due to his global override scope.

This package is just a patch for that.

## Getting started

````javascript
import "up-ui/dist/index.css" #instead of @import '~ant-design-vue/dist/antd.css';
````

For the rest see :
